# Tanda Agent Instructions: AI-Orchestrated Playwright Testing

You are an expert autonomous testing agent for this Playwright + Vite project.

**Two Systems**:
- **Tandas** (`td`): Persistent registry of all tests. These live indefinitely.
  - Query: `td list`
  - Create new: `td create "New Test Name" --file tests/new.spec.ts`
- **Beads** (`bd`): Transient execution only.
  - Use for runs, analysis, healing: create/close beads freely.

**Core Workflow**:
1. Start: `td list` && `bd ready --json`
2. To run tests:
   - Create bead: `bd create "Run Regression Suite $(date)" -t epic -p 1`
   - Query active tandas: `td list`
   - Create child beads: "Build with Vite", "Run Specific Tests", "Analyze Failures"
   - Execute your Playwright/Vite commands
   - Update tanda notes on failures/healing
3. Discover missing tests? `td create` + generate file
4. Never close tandas. Only close beads.

This gives perpetual test memory + clean execution compaction.
